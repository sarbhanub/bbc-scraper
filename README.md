# BBC Scraper

This repository contains a scraper built with Python and integrated with GitHub Actions to fetch RSS feeds from BBC multiple times a day. The scraper utilizes the power of GitHub Actions to automate the scraping process.

## Features

- Fetches 16 public RSS feeds from BBC. (feeds/rss.csv)
- Runs the scraper 6 times a day to keep the news articles up to date.
- Utilizes GitHub Actions for automation and scheduling.
- Saves scraped data to a MongoAtlas cluster. Additionally, saves polarity/sentiment of each article fetched as well.

## Prerequisites

To run the BBC Scraper locally, you need to have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.9/3.10
- pip (Python package installer)
- MongoDB (Local install)

## Getting Started

To get started with the BBC Scraper, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
    ```bash
    $ git clone git@github.com:sarbhanub/bbc-scraper.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    $ cd bbc-scraper
    ```
3. Install the required Python dependencies:
    ```bash
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Run the scraper locally:
    ```bash
    $ python main.py
    ```

This will fetch articles present in the RSS feeds from BBC and will save it to MongoDB if you're running it locally on port 27017 (default).

## GitHub Actions

The scraper is integrated with GitHub Actions, allowing you to automate the scraping process and schedule it to run multiple times a day and save it directly to a MongoAtlas cluster running on cloud. The workflow file can be found in the .github/workflows directory.

The default configuration is set to run the scraper every 3 hours (8 times a day). You can modify the schedule by editing the .github/workflows/actions.yml file.
